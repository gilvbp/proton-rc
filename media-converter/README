This module is a gstreamer plugin which provides the ability to replace media
data encoded in certain formats with media encoded in another format. There
are two main components, `videoconv` for converting video data provided to
Quartz and Media Foundation, and `audioconv` for converting audio data
provided to XAudio2.

The broad idea is to hash the incoming data and replace it with data looked up
from a cache. If there is a cache miss, then the data is recorded to disk and
instead replaced by "blank" media. The conversion should be transparent to the
application (Wine, FAudio) so no changes are required to the application.

See the accompanying source files for more information.
